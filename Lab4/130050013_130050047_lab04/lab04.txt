step 1 ->
	   1) command -> set lan [$ns make-lan -trace on $nodelist $opt(bw) $opt(delay) $opt(ll) $opt(ifq) $opt(mac) $opt(chan)]
	      arguments-> ns - assigning to the current network simulator
	      			  make-lan
	      			  -trace on - gives the trace in trace file
	      			  $nodelist - refers to all the nodes connected through this LAN
	      			  $opt(bw) - sets the bandwidth of LAN
	      			  $opt(delay)  - sets the delay
	      			  $opt(ll) - sets the link layer
	      			  $opt(ifq) - Interface queue
	      			  $opt(mac) - sets Mac layer type
	      			  $opt(chan) - sets channel type

	      MAC protocol was specified using these 
	      			set opt(mac)	Mac/802_3

	      			and  argument 	" $opt(mac) " of set lan

	    2) Bandwidth of LAN is 1Mbps

	       We found it using 
				set opt(bw)	1Mb

				and this was used as an argument in 'set lan'

		3) Rate of sending packets - 100Kbps

			Found using 
					set rate 100Kb
					$cbr_($i) set rate_ $rate

				and at each node we are using this CBR for generating traffic

		4) 	Packet size is 1000 Bytes

			Found using
					$cbr_($i) set packetSize_ 1000 

			Inter Packet Gap is 0.08s
				found it using (1000*8 )/ 100000 sec


		5)    Starting time is given by ->  $ns at 0.5 "$cbr_($i) start"
			  Ending Time is given by   -> $ns at $opt(fin) "$cbr_($i) stop"  
			  								and 
			  								set opt(fin) 10.5;

			  so the Duration of simulation is = 10.5 - 0.5 sec
			  								   = 10 sec

		6) The Destination for all the Traffic is Node 0 which automatically generated on creating a LAN connection as a sink.

			by seeing the trace file generated on running simulation.	


step 3 ->
		
		1) Total no of Packets recieved at reciever are = 500	
			cat csmacd.tr | grep ^r | wc -l

		2) No of Packets Dropped = 0
			cat csmacd.tr | grep ^d | wc -l

			Offered load is very less than 1 Mbps

		3) System Throughput =  (8 * 1000 * 500)/ 10
							 =   0.4 Mbps

			Efficiency  =  40%

		4) The system efficiency is not 100% because each node is sending at only 100Kbps on a 1Mbps Link and there are only 4 nodes. So we are not utilizing the entire Bandwidth available to us.

		5) Node 1 Throughput = 0.1Mbps
			Node 2 Throughput = 0.1Mbps
			Node 3 Throughput = 0.1Mbps
			Node 4 Throughput = 0.1Mbps

		6) // COLLISION PROFILE //
			Packets generated by all nodes at time = 0.5s
			Got transmitted by all nodes at time = 0.5s
			Yes the packets collided.
			Packet from Node 2 received at : 0.508248s
			Packet from Node 4 received at : 0.517748s
			Packet from Node 3 received at : 0.526604s
			Packet from Node 1 received at : 0.534816s

			Collision Winning order:
			2>4>3>1

		4)  Throughput   
					When the number of nodes are 8 then 
				 			Throughput	almost reaches value of 0.8 Mbps
							That is each node is getting approximately 0.1 Mbps speed (100Kbps) which is equal to its data rate.

				Whereas when number of nodes are 12 then
							Throughput is approx. 0.9 Mbps
							Which means on an average each node is not able to completely utilize its entire 100Kbps data rate and some packets are getting dropped.

			Efficiency

					when nodes = 8
							efficiency is approx 75% 
							 that is we are only able to utilize 75% of the 1Mbps bandwidth

					when nodes = 12
							efficiency is increased to approx 90%
							Because some of the time gets utilized in resolving collisions hence the overall efficiency doesn't reach 100%

			% packets dropped

					when nodes = 8
						No of packets dropped is very less (~1) as the buffer queue remains mostly empty as offered load < 1Mbps 

					when nodes = 12
						No of packets dropped increases by a large amount as the packets start dropping at the queue since offered load > 1Mbps

		5) we would suggest no of nodes = 13
			As in that case the Efficiency is slightly greater than 90%
			also the percentage of packets dropped is approx 6%

			if we increase  beyond 13 then efficiency is not changing much but the percentage of packets lost increases drastically

Exercise 3
------------

		1) 	The nodes are sharing the available resources unequally, i.e. not everyone is able to use the available resources equally. Some  nodes are getting very high throughput whereas some are getting poor throughput.


		2) Jain's fairness index = 0.8656525052
			Clearly this is less than 1 ( which supports our observation from the graph - that is not everyone is equally sharing the resources)

			But however the value of Fairness index is pretty good, which means that in general Ethernet is fair to the nodes connected to it.
